This is the original server that created the sql file. Due to a longer period of practice and the expiration of the rented server, the cloud database used for image matching has been cleared. In the future, we will definitely rent additional servers for the practical promotion and use of various platforms.

However, our current fees will be more used for the publication of this article and the maintenance of this intellectual property. At the same time, we have applied for two software copyrights in China for this platform.
